TASK 01:
The Program simulates a car park payment system where users input details such as the day of the week, arrival hour, parking duration, and a frequent parking number for potential discounts. The program calculates the parking price based on these inputs, considering different pricing schemes for different days and arrival times. It also offers discounts for valid frequent parking numbers. Overall, the program ensures accurate pricing and discount calculations while providing a user-friendly experience for customers.
TASK 02:
This code implements a simple car park payment system. It consists of functions to calculate the check digit for a frequent parking number, validate the format of the parking number, and calculate the parking price based on various factors such as the day of the week, arrival hour, and parking duration. The main function orchestrates user interactions, prompting for input of necessary details like day, arrival hour, and payment amount, ensuring that the payment meets the required criteria. It then calculates and displays the parking price, updates the daily total payment, and finally presents the daily total. Overall, the code provides a straightforward system for calculating parking fees and maintaining payment records.
TASK 03: 
This code defines functions to facilitate the calculation and validation processes for a car park payment system. The `calculate_check_digit` function computes the check digit for a given frequent parking number, essential for validation. The `validate_frequent_park_num` function ensures the correct format of the frequent parking number, confirming its length and the presence of digits. It also checks the calculated check digit against the provided one. The `calculate_park_price` function calculates the parking price based on the day of the week, arrival hour, parking duration, and any applicable discounts for frequent parking numbers. Prices vary depending on the day and time of arrival. The main function orchestrates user interactions, prompting for input such as the day of the week, arrival hour, parking duration, and frequent parking number if available. It then calculates and displays the parking price, prompting the user for payment and ensuring the payment amount meets the required criteria. Finally, it updates and displays the daily total payment.
